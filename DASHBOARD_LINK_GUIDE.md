# Quick Fix - Add Dashboard Link to README

Your README.md [111] already has the dashboard link in it, but here's exactly where it appears and how to verify:

---

## âœ… The Dashboard Link is Already in Your README

**Location:** Near the top, in the "Quick Links" section

```markdown
## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Links

| Link | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ðŸ”— **[Live Dashboard](https://bmdz.shinyapps.io/powerco_churn_dash/)** | Interactive analytics & scenario testing |
| ðŸ“Š **[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/BMDZ/powerco-churn-prediction-r)** | Complete source code |
| ðŸ“– **[Documentation](https://github.com/BMDZ/powerco-churn-prediction-r#readme)** | Full setup & guides |
```

**And also appears in:**

Section: "ðŸš€ Live Dashboard"
```markdown
## ðŸš€ Live Dashboard

The **interactive dashboard** provides real-time insights:

### Features:
- âœ… Real-time scenario simulator
- âœ… Interactive customer filtering & search
- âœ… Responsive design (desktop + mobile)
- âœ… Sub-second load times
- âœ… No user login required

**ðŸ”— [Launch Dashboard](https://bmdz.shinyapps.io/powerco_churn_dash/)**
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ If Dashboard Link is NOT Showing

### Problem 1: Dashboard Link Not Active
**Solution:** Edit README.md and make sure these lines are present:

```markdown
| ðŸ”— **[Live Dashboard](https://bmdz.shinyapps.io/powerco_churn_dash/)** | Interactive analytics & scenario testing |
```

### Problem 2: Link Needs Updating
**If your dashboard URL is different**, replace `https://bmdz.shinyapps.io/powerco_churn_dash/` with your actual URL

---

## âœ… Verify on GitHub

Go to: https://github.com/BMDZ/powerco-churn-prediction-r

**You should see:**
- âœ… README.md displayed on homepage
- âœ… "Live Dashboard" link in Quick Links section (clickable)
- âœ… Blue link text indicating it's clickable

---

## ðŸš€ If You Need to Update README.md

Edit README.md locally and add/verify these sections:

```markdown
# PowerCo Customer Churn Prediction - ML Solution

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Links

| Link | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ðŸ”— **[Live Dashboard](https://bmdz.shinyapps.io/powerco_churn_dash/)** | Interactive analytics & scenario testing |
