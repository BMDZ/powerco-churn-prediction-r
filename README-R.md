## 📊 Dataset

**Source:** BCG Gamma Data Science Case Study

**Data Files:**
1. **ml_case_training_data.csv** (16,096 SME customers)
   - Customer demographics and contract details
   - Consumption patterns (electricity & gas)
   - Pricing and margin data
   - Channel and origin information

- Churners: 9.7%
- **Challenge:** Significant class imbalance

---

## 🔬 Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Script:** `01_EDA.R`

- Data quality assessment (missing values, outliers)
- Target variable analysis and class distribution
- Feature distributions comparing churners vs non-churners
- Correlation analysis
- Statistical significance testing (t-tests)

**Key Insights:**
- Consumption patterns differ significantly between churners and non-churners
- Temporal features (days to renewal) show strong correlation with churn
- Economic features (margins, discounts) are critical predictors

### 2. Feature Engineering
**Script:** `02_Feature_Engineering.R`

Created 25+ predictive features across categories:

**Temporal Features:**
- `days_to_renew` - Days until contract renewal
- `tenure_days` - Customer tenure in days
- `contract_len` - Contract length
- `days_mod` - Days since last product modification

**Consumption Features:**
- `avg_mon_cons` - Average monthly consumption
- `cons_trend` - Consumption trend (last month vs average)
- `cons_pct` - Consumption change percentage
- `total_cons` - Total electricity + gas consumption

**Economic Features:**
- `margin_pc` - Margin per consumption unit
- `est_rev` - Estimated revenue
- `disc_rate` - Discount rate

**Feature Selection:**
- Correlation-based ranking with churn target
- Selected top 25 features for modeling

### 3. Model Development
**Script:** `03_Modeling.R`

**Models Tested:**
| Model | ROC-AUC | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|---------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.35 | 0.90 | 0.90 | 0.997 | 0.946 |
| Random Forest | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| **XGBoost** | **0.09** | **0.93** | **0.93** | **0.999** | **0.963** |

**Best Model: XGBoost**
- Hyperparameters: 200 trees, depth=6, lr=0.05
- Class imbalance handled with SMOTE via `step_smote()`
- Preprocessing: normalization, dummy encoding, zero-variance removal

**Tidymodels Pipeline:**
```r
recipe(churn ~ ., data = train) %>%
  update_role(id, new_role = "ID") %>%
  step_novel(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_impute_median(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors())
```

### 4. Model Interpretation
**Script:** `04_Model_Interpretation.R`

**SHAP Analysis Results:**

**Top 5 Churn Drivers:**
1. **avg_mon_cons** (Mean |SHAP|: 0.101)
   - Higher average consumption → Higher churn risk
   - Correlation: 0.676

2. **total_cons** (Mean |SHAP|: 0.101)
   - Lower total consumption → Higher churn risk
   - Correlation: -0.651

3. **cons_last_month** (Mean |SHAP|: 0.002)
   - Lower recent consumption → Higher churn risk
   - Correlation: -0.108

4. **tenure_days** (Mean |SHAP|: 0.002)
   - Shorter tenure → Higher churn risk
   - Correlation: -0.211

5. **contract_len** (Mean |SHAP|: 0.001)
   - Longer contracts → Higher churn risk
   - Correlation: 0.180

**Business Insights:**
- Consumption patterns are the strongest predictors
- Customer tenure and loyalty matter significantly
- Economic factors (margins, discounts) play secondary role

### 5. Business Impact Analysis
**Script:** `05_Business_Analysis.R`

**ROI Calculation:**

**Optimal Strategy:** Target customers with churn probability ≥ 0.15

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Test Customers | 48,251 |
| Baseline Churners | 4,738 (9.8%) |
| Optimal Threshold | 0.15 |
| Discount Cost (annual) | €7,359,120 |
| Expected Revenue Saved | €36,468,660 |
| **Net Benefit** | **€29,109,540** |
| **ROI** | **395.7%** |

**Customer Segmentation Strategy:**

1. **High Risk (≥70% probability):** 
   - Action: 20% discount + dedicated account manager
   - Expected retention: 75%

2. **Medium Risk (40-70%):** 
   - Action: 10-15% discount + loyalty benefits
   - Expected retention: 60%

3. **Low Risk (<40%):** 
   - Action: Standard service, monitor for changes
