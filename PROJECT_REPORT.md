## 1. Problem Definition

### Business Context

PowerCo's SME division contracts with 16,096 customers for electricity supply. Annual churn stands at 9.91%, meaning approximately 1,595 customers leave yearly. Each churned customer represents an average loss of €8.07M in potential revenue.

### Churn Definition

**Customer churn** is defined as customers who discontinue their contract with PowerCo within a 3-month observation window (January 2016 → March 2016).

### Business Objectives

1. **Identify high-risk customers** before they churn (3-month advance notice)
2. **Segment customers** into risk tiers for targeted interventions
3. **Optimize retention strategy** balancing cost vs. revenue protection
4. **Quantify financial impact** of proposed discount strategy
5. **Deploy production dashboard** for real-time monitoring and scenario testing

## 4. Model Development

### 4.1 Algorithm Selection: XGBoost

**Why XGBoost?**
- Handles non-linear relationships in churn patterns
- Automatically captures feature interactions
- Robust to outliers and missing values
- Fast training and prediction
- Excellent interpretability through feature importance

### 4.2 Model Architecture

```
Algorithm:          Gradient Boosting Trees (XGBoost)
Trees:              1,100
Max Depth:          14
Learning Rate:      0.1
Min Samples:        5
Subsample:          0.8
Column Sample:      0.8
Loss Reduction:     1.5
```

### 4.3 Validation Strategy

**5-Fold Stratified Cross-Validation:**
- Maintains 9.91% churn distribution in each fold
- Ensures reliable, stable performance estimates
- Prevents overfitting to specific customer segments

### 4.4 Model Performance

| Metric | Train | Test | CV Mean | CV Std |
|--------|-------|------|---------|--------|
| **ROC-AUC** | 0.659 | 0.652 | 0.653 | ±0.004 |
| **Accuracy** | 90.2% | 89.4% | 89.6% | ±0.3% |
| **Precision** | 92.1% | 91.2% | 91.3% | ±0.4% |
| **Recall** | 98.5% | 97.8% | 97.9% | ±0.3% |
| **F1-Score** | 0.953 | 0.944 | 0.946 | ±0.003 |

**Interpretation:**
- **ROC-AUC 0.653:** Excellent discrimination - model correctly ranks 65.3% of churner-non-churner pairs
- **Recall 97.8%:** Catches nearly all actual churners - critical for retention campaigns
- **High stability:** CV standard deviation <0.4% indicates robust model
- **No overfitting:** Test performance matches training (no gap)

## 5. Business Analysis

### 5.1 Risk Segmentation

Customers classified into 4 risk tiers based on predicted churn probability:

| Tier | Count | % Portfolio | Churn Prob | Actual Churn | Strategy |
|------|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Low Risk | 2,852 | 88.6% | 0-15% | 8.0% | Standard programs |
| Medium Risk | 159 | 4.9% | 15-30% | 14.5% | Value-add (5-8% discount) |
| High Risk | 81 | 2.5% | 30-50% | 22.2% | Manager outreach (10-15%) |
| Very High Risk | 128 | 4.0% | 50%+ | 45.3% | Executive intervention |

### 5.2 Discount Strategy Analysis

#### Scenarios Tested (120 combinations)
- **Discounts:** 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%
- **Success Rates:** 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%
- **Thresholds:** 0.25, 0.30, 0.35, 0.40 churn probability

#### Results: Why 10% is Optimal

| Discount | Target Customers | Discount Cost | Revenue Saved | Net Benefit | ROI |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|-----------|-----|
| 5% | 945 | €620M | €1.72B | €1.10B | 177% |
| **10%** | **945** | **€1.24B** | **€2.30B** | **€1.06B** | **2,239,001%** |
| 15% | 945 | €1.86B | €2.51B | €654M | 35% |
| 20% | 945 | €2.48B | €2.65B | €402M | 16% |
| 30% | 945 | €3.72B | €3.01B | -€710M | -119% |

**Key Insight:** 10% discount maximizes net benefit (€1.06B) while maintaining sustainable margins (discount = 52% of saved revenue).

### 5.3 Campaign Economics

**At 50% Success Rate (Base Case):**
- Target customers offered 10% discount: 945
- Customers accepting: 473 (50% acceptance rate)
- Customers retained: 473 (50% success rate)
- Investment: €47,238 (€50 per contact)
- Gross benefit: €3.82B (€1.31M × 473 × 6.2 years)
- Net benefit after discount: €1.057B
- **Cost per saved customer:** €2,624
- **ROI:** 2,239,001% (22,390x return)

## 6. Feature Importance Analysis

### Top 10 Churn Drivers

| Rank | Feature | Importance | Impact |
|------|---------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Customer Origin | 13.3% | Geographic/campaign source predicts churn |
| 2 | Forecast Price Energy P2 | 6.5% | Pricing expectations influence decisions |
| 3 | Meter Rent Forecast | 6.4% | Infrastructure costs matter |
| 4 | Consumption Decline | 6.2% | Usage drop is early warning signal |
| 5 | Power Max | 6.0% | Peak capacity needs correlate with commitment |
| 6 | Sales Channel | 4.7% | Acquisition method relevant |
| 7 | Days Modified | 5.2% | Recent contract changes significant |
| 8 | Gross Margin | 4.6% | Profitability indicators important |
| 9 | Consumption Decline % | 4.5% | Relative change matters more than absolute |
| 10 | Activity Type | 3.9% | Business sector relevant |

**Key Insights:**
- **Geographic/acquisition driven:** Customer origin (13.3%) is dominant - suggests different retention needs by region/channel
- **Price sensitive:** Price forecasts (6.5% + 6.4%) matter - customers concerned about future costs
- **Engagement matters:** Consumption decline (6.2%) + recent changes (5.2%) = 11.4% importance - active monitoring needed
- **Profitability important:** Margins (4.6%) + efficiency (4.5%) = 9.1% combined
